- Typescript comes along with the NodeJS installation. Typescript is a super set of Javascript. It is OO language which supports OOPS concepts. We have to specify the variable datatype and definition. Array, string, Boolean, Void, undefined, null - data type-annotation needs to be defined in the script file, Once the file is compiled, it will generate the javascript file.
- To Declare the type and value : var [identifier]:[type-annotation]=[value];
- For Loop and Enhanced For loop can be done within this type script:
````
for (var val in list) { 
   //statements 
}
````
- The syntax for declaring an external module is using keyword ‘export’ and ‘import’.
- To integrate typescript into an angular project, we need to have have nodejs and @angular/cli installed so that we can use ng command to generate the angualr project.
- typescript compiler command : tsc filename.ts
